# A list of awesome project ideas to help you learn!

This is a repository for random projects that would help you learn! You can contribute by creating a pull request and adding whatever project ideas, spelling mistakes, grammar mistakes, etc. that you would like! First, check if there is a directory for projects of that language/framework, if there is, just add a file to that directory, if not, create the file yourself, use \_'s for seperators ('spaces') and have no capital letters! Example: `React Native` => `react_native`! You will also need to add the project under the correct heading (or create a heading) in the `README.md`!

If you want to take things a step further, after adding a breif description of the project idea, you can add hints to creating it, as well as possible solutions! This would help people out with learning a new method, or even just showing someone that something exists in the specific programming language or framework.

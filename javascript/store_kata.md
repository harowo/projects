# Store Kata
In this small project you will create a Test Driven Project where you create a store that has a limited number of products to sell.
Customers can purchase goods, Employees can sell stuff to customers and earn commission on this. 


# Products
BOOK
VIDEOGAME
BANANA

# Business Rules

- The store currently sells physical books, video-games (online and physical)
- The store has also a optional membership for it's clients
- The membership allows specific discounts for each product sold in the store
- The store will send a 5% commission to the employee that sells a physical product
- The store plans to expand selling also bananas (why not?) and coffee drinks. 
You don't have to implement those yet, but keep in mind that new products can be added to the store
